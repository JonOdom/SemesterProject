# CSCI 3308 SemesterProject

**Title:** Bullet Hell Multiplayer Game (wip)

**Who:** Zachary Johnson, Booker Lightman, Charles Davies, Jonathan Odom

**Description:** An HTML game inspired by agar.io in which you pilot a ship against other players, and attempt to last the longest. Will either be based strictly in browser, or potentially as an app.

**Vision Statement:** A game that is both educational to develop and fun to play. *With added fiber!!!!*

**Motivation:** We wanted to gain some practical knowledge not in only in games, but also web networking and potentially apps.

**Risks:** 
* None of us knew eachother prior to the project/this semester
* Lack of availability for some resources (specifically a dedicated web server)
* None of us have huge amounts of experience with JavaScript or HTML
* None of us have experience with graphics

**Mitigation Strategy:** 
* Internet Resources
* Asking the CS Department for permission for a server
* Consistent group meetings

**List of Requirements:** 
*User:*
* As a user, I want to be able to connect so that I can play.
* As a user, I want to be able to learn the controls quickly so that I can play faster.
*Functional:*
* As a developer, I want a hitbox so that users can recognize when they are dead.
* As a developer, I want a login page so that I can keep track of users.
* As a developer, I want the ships to be able move around.
* As a developer, I want the ships to be able to shoot.
*Non-functional:*
* As a developer, I want a server so that I can host the game, and users can connect.
* As a developer, I would like a faster server so that the game can perform more capably.

**Methodology:** Agile

**Project Tracking Software:** GitHub
