# CSCI 3308 SemesterProject

**Title:** Bullet Hell Multiplayer Game (wip)

**Who:** Zachary Johnson, Booker Lightman, Charles Davies, Jonathan Odom

**Description:** An HTML game inspired by agar.io in which you pilot a ship against other players, and attempt to last the longest. Will either be based strictly in browser, or potentially as an app.

**Vision Statement:** A game that is both educational to develop and fun to play. *With added fiber!!!!*

**Motivation:** We wanted to gain some practical knowledge not in only in games, but also web networking and potentially apps.

**Risks:** * None of us knew eachother prior to the project/this semester
* Lack of availability for some resources (specifically a dedicated web server)
* None of us have huge amounts of experience with JavaScript or HTML
* None of us have experience with graphics
